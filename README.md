# Personal Portfolio Website



https://wesscarpa.github.io/index.html#projects

A fully custom-coded portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase projects, experience, and education. This project functions both as a professional portfolio and as an experimental front-end engineering platform focused on interactive design, animation, and creative programming.

---

## Overview

This website was built entirely from scratch without templates, frameworks, or site builders. The goal was not only to present projects, but to engineer the system behind the presentation.

The site emphasizes:
- Clean structural design  
- Custom animation systems  
- Interactive simulations  
- Performance-conscious front-end development  
- Scalable project organization  

It serves as both a portfolio and a sandbox for experimenting with browser-based creative coding.

## Features

### Star Wars–Style Scrolling Intro

A custom-built cinematic text crawl implemented using CSS transforms and JavaScript timing control to recreate the perspective scrolling effect.

### Interactive Simulations

Embedded browser-based simulations that demonstrate technical projects directly within the site using dynamic JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.

### Responsive Design

Custom CSS layout built to adapt across screen sizes without external frameworks.

### Modular JavaScript Structure

Organized, reusable JavaScript components designed for scalability and maintainability.

### Performance-Focused Architecture

Minimal dependencies, lightweight structure, and optimized animation handling.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 – Semantic structure and content organization  
- CSS3 – Layout systems, animations, transforms, responsiveness  
- Vanilla JavaScript – Interactivity, animation timing, event handling, DOM manipulation  

No frameworks or templates were used.

## Architecture

The project follows a clear separation of concerns:

- `index.html` – Core structure  
- `styles.css` – Styling and animations  
- `script.js` – Interactive logic and dynamic components  

Animations utilize:
- CSS transitions and transforms  
- `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth updates  
- Event listeners for interaction control
